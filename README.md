# Text-to-Image Generation

This project focuses on generating high-quality images from textual descriptions without using any pre-trained models or external APIs. The goal is to build a fully custom model using neural networks, capable of understanding textual inputs and translating them into visually coherent images. This project adheres to industry-standard project structures, ensuring modularity, scalability, and ease of future extensions.

## Features

- **Custom Model Architecture**: Built from scratch using deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- **Text Encoder**: Utilizes NLP techniques to extract meaningful features from the input text.
- **Image Decoder**: Transforms the encoded text representations into realistic images.
- **Training Pipeline**: A robust pipeline for preprocessing, training, and evaluation of the model on various datasets.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques applied to improve the model's generalization capabilities.
- **Image Evaluation**: Metrics to evaluate the quality and coherence of generated images based on input text.

## Roadmap

- Implement the text encoder using embeddings or transformers.
- Develop the image decoder using GANs, VAEs, or CNN-based architectures.
- Train the model on a diverse dataset of image-caption pairs.
- Fine-tune and optimize the model for better performance.
- Evaluate generated images using metrics like FID (Frechet Inception Distance) and user-based evaluations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-image-generation.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset and configure paths in the `config.json` file.
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Generate images from text:
   ```bash
   python generate.py --text "A cat sitting on a chair"
   ```

## Dataset

The model is trained on custom image-caption datasets that can be modified or extended as required.
